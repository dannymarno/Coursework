    <h2>how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software</h2>
    
    <p>Due to previously having used the likes of Slack, Trello and X-Code, these would most likely be the IT systems i would prefer to use. I found them easy to use and navigate, they were also quite intuitive and i enjoyed learning uses and ability of the features offered.</p>
