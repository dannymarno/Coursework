            <h1>Unit 1 Outcome 2</h1>
            
            <p>2.1 are you happy with the tools you used?</p>

        <p>I am very happy with the tools i used to create my website, i found visual studio code easy to work with and was able to navigate my way around the html and css pages with a clear view of where i was and what i was doing at all times. Trello helped me stay on course with where i was up to during development.</p>

        <p>2.2 Were the tools appropriate - 
           I found the tools at my disposal to be very appropriate for building my website, visual studio code was easy to navigate and code and i found trello helpful in keeping me on track with each section of the website i was building, i would be happy to continue using both visual studio code and trello on any future projects.</p>

        <p>2.3 Strengths and weakness of my project - 
           Some of the strengths of my project were the ability to use and size my images and being able to use font size and color on text. My weakness making the project were applying different fonts to each page and applying the use of div although i was able to use it effectively by the end of the project.</p>

        <p>2.4 Any further improvements i can make - 
           I could make improvements by adding more color to my pages backgrounds and text and adding different images or multiple images on each page, i could also try adding multiple fonts to different headers within each page.</p>

        <p>2.5 Review outcomes -
           Having reviewed the outcomes to check if they are fit for purpose, i am happy with what i have done so far apart from the need to add a screenshot of my trello board to unit.</p>

        <p>1.3 which i shall be doing in the future, over than that i feel i have done what was needed this far.</p>
