    <h2>1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account</h2>

    <p>There are many disabilities that can affect how people can use the web such as poor vision and poor hearing.
       Barriers that people with low vision may encounter on the Web include: Web pages with absolute font sizes that do not enlarge easily Web pages that, because of inconsistent layout, are difficult to navigate when enlarged, due to loss of surrounding context browsers that do not support user override of authors' style sheets</p>

    <p>Color Blindness</p>
    
    <p>Color blindness is a lack of sensitivity to certain colors. Common forms of color blindness include difficulty distinguishing between red and green, or between yellow and blue. Sometimes color blindness results in the inability to perceive any color.
       To use the Web, people with color blindness may use their own style sheets to override the font and background color choices of the author.</p>
