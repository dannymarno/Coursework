<h2>Benifits of using IT systems</h2>

<p>Some of the benefits of using the IT systems were i was able to work in a quick manner and able to manage files and images easily. Some of the drawbacks were the time it took me to understand some of the terms and layouts of each system. I feel i would of worked well alone or part of a team for each project.</p>

<p>3.2 Ways to improve productivity
   I feel i could of used trello more effectively to plan how each page was going to look and what the content of each page would finally look like thus improving my overall efficiency and productivity.</p>

<p>3.3 Solutions to improve productivity -
I would use trello more effectively by using it as a planning tool more often than i did, i would also spend more time thinking of more ideas for each page of my website and how to make it look better or what fonts and colors to use.</p>

<p>3.4 How i would test digital solutions - 
I would test any digital solutions by trying my website on different platforms such as on different web browsers on different machines such as on pc mac and phones.</p>

<p>Unit 2 outcome 1 - </p>

<p>1.1 Content layout of each page - 
I have added an image to the top of each page and a nav bar underneath the image, i have then added the content from each unit and outcome underneath that, i have added a black background with red writing but i may change this before the site goes live.</p>
